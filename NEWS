Version 2.0, 2007-09-23

* Licensed under GPLv3 or later.

* mixal

** Location of listing file

By default, mixal creates listing file in the current working directory.

* mixsim

** The .mixsim file
When started in terminal mode, the utility searches for file `.mixsim'
in the current working directory and reads it, if present. The file
may contain any mixsim commands.

** The set of terminal commands is improved to make it compatible with GDB.

** New command, PASSCOUNT
Set the number of crossings after whcih to clear the breakpoint.

** Removed optional second argument to BREAK.
The functionality of `BREAK <ADDR> <COUNT>' is now obtained by two
commands:

BREAK <ADDR>
PASSCOUNT <N> <COUNT>

** New command DELETE.
An alias to CLEAR.

** New command IGNORE
Sets the number of hits to ignore before enabling the breakpoint.

** New commands ENABLE and DISABLE
Enable or disable the breakpoint with the given number.

** New command RUN
It is an alias for GO.

** New command SOURCE
Execute a file of mixsim commands.

** New command ADDRESS.
This command takes as its argument a breakpoint manipulation command
(DELETE, IGNORE, ENABLE, DISABLE, PASSCOUNT) with arguments
appropriate for the associated command.  However, the first argument
of the corresponding command is treated as MIX address, instead of a
breakpoint number.

** New command INFO.
An alias to LIST.

** New command SHELL.
Executes a subordinate shell or a shell command. Abbreviated to !.

** NEXT and STEP take optional argument.
The argument, if given, specifies number of instructions to
execute. Default is 1.

** INFO BREAK takes an optional argument specifying breakpoint number to list.
If prefixed with ADDRESS, it treats the argument as a MIX location and
lists all breakpoints set on that location.


Version 1.2

* New terminal mode (mixsim -t) allows to debug MIXAL programs
* New option -r to mixal allows to produce 'raw' MIX programs. It is useful to
experiment with loader routines.

* Mixal prints a warning if an ALF constant is preceeded by more than two 
spaces and followed by a printable character.
